Hello,

In this project, I created simple Admin Panel for E-Commerce. It is quite basic. Also i used Firebase for images storage. And i used Redux for Login.

I developed API using PHP. Also I built the API with my own MVC Framework.

I used JWT library for login operations on Client-Side and Server-Side
